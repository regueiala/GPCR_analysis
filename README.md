# GPCR Dynamics Analysis Library

A library of tools for analyzing GPCR (G Protein-Coupled Receptor) dynamics.

**This library is currently under active development.**  
Features, functions, and documentation are subject to change.

## Overview
This project aims to provide a set of Python tools for analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of GPCRs, including:
- RMSD calculations  
- Pocket volume tracking  
- Helix tilt and kink angle computation
